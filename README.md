# What is this?
A repository to host the files of course unit "Data Mining".

# Project 
This final project had as main objective to use a business analysis tool from Microsoft Corporation that is called PowerBI. This program is designed to provide visualizations and business intelligence features, with its simple graphical interface so that any type of user can create their own reports and dashboards. The group had to choose a dataset to analyze in PowerBI, being the chosen one taken from the Kaggle platform, with the theme of NBA (National Basketball Association).

The description of the project is in [Projeto_DM](https://github.com/Nunomcmm/data_mining/blob/master/Projeto_DM.pdf).
